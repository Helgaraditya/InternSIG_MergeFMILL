# InternSIG_MergeFMILL
Python script to automate monthly data merging of Finish Mill production reports from PT Semen Indonesia. It reads multiple Excel sheets with different column structures (FMILL#1â€“#9), standardizes the format, handles missing columns, and appends only new data into a consolidated Excel file without duplicating previously processed files.
